You will need to download a csv file on your local machine for the map code to work

I mapped the colors of the points based on zip code ZHVI (A measure of the typical home value and market changes)

Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ and drop down "Geography" to "ZIP Code," then download.

If anyone can suggest a better metric to use, I'm of course willing to oblige and see where the data leads. I just figured this ZHVI value might be better than pure home value since it incorportates market changes (whatever that means for our case..)
