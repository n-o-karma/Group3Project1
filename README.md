Please consider 'data_acq_and_cleanup.ipynb' our code submission for this assignment. The presentation notebook is titled 'Presentation Outline & Formatting.ipynb'.

You will need to download a csv file on your local machine for Nick's map code to work; It is too large to upload to GitHub.

Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ , find Home Values: ZHVI at the middle of the page and drop down "Geography" to "ZIP Code," then download.

The rest of the CSVs are in the Resources folder.

You will also need a Geoapify key for the maps to generate.
