# Group3Project1

Introduction:
Please consider 'data_acq_and_cleanup.ipynb' our code submission for this assignment. The presentation notebook is titled 'Presentation Outline & Formatting.ipynb'.

Summary:
The Python project cleans and analyzes rental prices, housing prices, housing market volume, and crime incident data from Philadelphia, PA over a timeframe of 7 years. The datasets were reviewed and compared to find a relationship between the pricing and crime rates sorted by zip codes.

Requirements:
You will need to download a CSV file on your local machine for Nick's map code to work. It is too large to upload to GitHub.

Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ , find Home Values: ZHVI at the middle of the page and drop down "Geography" to "ZIP Code," then download.

The rest of the CSVs used in the paroject are located in the Resources folder.

You will also need a Geoapify API key for the maps to generate.
